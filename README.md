# vagrant-python-learning

A vagrant-built Virtual Machine for learning Python, Django, iPython, etc

## Overview

The two Vagrant Virtual Machines defined in the following projects are intended for learning Python, Django (web framework), and iPython.  They are based on Fedora 21 GNOME and XFCE.

## Pre-requisites

To make use of these virtual machines you must have the following installed

* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Dependencies 

The base box that the Vagrant setup uses is hosted under a personal Dropbox account.  It would likely be possible to re-use a similar virtual machine if necassary.  Essentially this is just a basebox from a Live CD install of the Fedora operating system with SSH enabled and puppet installed.
